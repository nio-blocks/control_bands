Equal to 0 if there is only one value in the band. This is equal to the mean of the moving ranges.\n- **deviations**: How many band sizes this signal's value is from the mean. Equal to 0 if there is only one value in the band.",
    "Description": "Create \"Moving Range\" charts for different numeric values.\nThis block will maintain \"bands\" for a period of time and for different groups of signals. A band is basically a moving range calculation that updates dynamically. This block is useful for determining if a signal is an outlier from normal operation.\nFor an explanation on the mathematics of the moving range calculation, see http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc322.htm",
